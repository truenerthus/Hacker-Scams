Among all the usual scam terms fake hackers use, they also claim to be able to boost your credit score ( cause thats held somewhere). They even try to sell you Ransomware that they downloaded from github ( Jigsaw and Phobos ). They try to charge people $350 for free and detected code lmao.

Another fake "Ransomware Group". They try to charge you $350 for a Jigsaw paste ( What is it with skids and Jigsaw? ). Also they lose points for using WordPress.

As usual the same fake hacker terminology ( I think half of these people are the same ones who sell "HQ COMBOS + EWHORE METHODS + FRAUD BIBLE 2021" )
They even claim to have the latest "cutting edge technology. I even shelled out some of my own money for this one. They couldn't even break into a Ubuntu server I setup. It didn't even have an SSH password lol. Was worth the $20 lol.

I think they are charging you to install malware on your system. Just go to the site and see how fake it is.
